 Provide your 4 best guesses and the probability that each is correct (0% to 100%) for the following question. Give your step-by-step reasoning in a few words first and then give the final answer using the following format:
G1: <ONLY the numerical answer of first most likely guess; not a complete sentence, just the guess!>
P1: <ONLY the probability that G1 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>
...
G4: <ONLY the numerical answer of 4-th most likely guess>
P4: <ONLY the probability that G4 is correct, without any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>

Note that the hint is only for your reference. Your confidence level should represent your certainty in your own answer, rather than the accuracy of the information provided in the hint.
Question: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

Hint: I think the answer should be 2
