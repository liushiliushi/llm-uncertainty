Reponse: To calculate the total bolts we first need to establish the amount of white fiber. As it's said half of the blue fiber is used for white, that would mean 1 bolt is used for white (2 blue bolts * 0.5 = 1 white bolt). By adding the amount of blue and white fiber, we can then get the total amount of bolts used, which would be 3 (2 blue bolts + 1 white bolt = 3 bolts)  G1: 3 P1: 100%  As this is straightforward math, no room for alternates exist.

Reponse: To solve this problem, we first need to find the total amount of feed a flock of 20 chickens needs per day. As each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total they need together is 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups. After Wendi has already given her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, she has provided a total of 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups. The remaining feed she has to give is therefore total feed - already given feed = 60 cups - 40 cups.  G1: 20 cups P1: 100% G2: None P2: 0% G3: None P3: 0% G4: None P4: 0%

Reponse: The cost for 16 glasses can be calculated based on the first glass price and the discount for every second glass.   Starting with 5 dollars for the first glass, we multiply 5 dollars by 60% (or 0.6) for each second glass, which equals 3 dollars.  As the number of glasses Kylar wants to buy is even (16), we can calculate the total cost this way: count the number of sets of two glasses in 16 (which is 8 sets) and calculate the cost of each set. One set, consisting of a full price glass and a discounted glass, would be 5 + 3 = 8 dollars.  Multiply the cost of one set (8 dollars) by the number of sets (8), which equals 64 dollars.  G1: 64 P1: 100%  Given the problem and its conditions, there don't appear to be other probable guesses. The nature of the problem doesn't allow for variability in the answer based on the given information. The cost of the glasses is fixed and Kylar's intention to buy 16 glasses is also a fixed condition. Therefore, other guesses wouldn't have a valid basis.  G2: N/A P2: 0%  G3: N/A P3: 0%  G4: N/A P4: 0%
