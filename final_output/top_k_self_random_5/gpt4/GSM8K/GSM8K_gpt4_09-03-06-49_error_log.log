Reponse: First, we need to figure out how many eggs Janet has left after she eats three for breakfast and uses four to bake muffins. That's a total of 7 eggs she uses, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left. She sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 every day.  G1: 18 P1: 100%  As the calculation is straightforward and no other variables or possibilities are given in the problem, there are no other reasonable guesses.

Reponse: The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. To determine the total amount of bolts used, we need to add together the amount of blue and white fiber used.  Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber used. The problem states this is 2 bolts.  Step 2: Identify the amount of white fiber used. The problem states this is half the amount of blue fiber used. Half of 2 is 1, so 1 bolt of white fiber is used.  Step 3: Add together the amount of blue and white fiber used. This gives us a total of 2 + 1 = 3 bolts.  There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in these calculations, so the probability of this answer being correct is 100%.

Reponse: The question states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half as much white fiber. This means that the robe takes 1 bolt of white fiber because half of 2 is 1. So, to find the total number of bolts it takes, we can add the number of blue fiber bolts to the number of white fiber bolts.  G1: 3 P1: 100%  Since the question clearly states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber, there are no other possible correct guesses. Therefore, there will be no G2, G3, and G4 with their respective probabilities.

Reponse: To answer this question, we first need to calculate how much white fiber is needed. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and we know that 2 bolts of blue fiber are needed, then 1 bolt of white fiber is needed (2/2=1). Then, we add the amounts of blue and white fiber to find the total amount of fiber needed. This gives us 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts in total.  G1: 3 P1: 100%  Since the question provides specific amounts of blue and white fiber needed and there's no ambiguity in the provided information, there are no other possible answers.

Reponse: First, calculate the total investment by Josh: $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.  Next, calculate the value increase: 150% of $130,000 is $195,000.  Then, calculate the new value of the house: $130,000 (initial value) + $195,000 (increase) = $325,000.  Finally, calculate the profit: $325,000 (final value) - $130,000 (investment) = $195,000.  G1: 195000 P1: 100%  This is the only correct answer based on the data provided. Thus, there are no other guesses.  G2: N/A P2: 0%  G3: N/A P3: 0%  G4: N/A P4: 0%

Reponse: First, we need to calculate how much the house's value increased after the repairs. We do this by taking the cost of the repairs, $50,000, and multiplying it by 150% (1.5). This gives us $75,000. We then add this to the initial cost of the house, $80,000, to get the final value of the house after the repairs, $155,000.   Next, we calculate the total cost spent by Josh, which is the sum of the initial cost of the house and the cost of repairs, $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.  The profit is then calculated by subtracting the total cost from the final value of the house, $155,000 - $130,000.  G1: 25,000 P1: 100%  Since the steps followed are straightforward and provide a single solution, there are no other guesses.  G2: None P2: 0% G3: None P3: 0% G4: None P4: 0%

Reponse: The total meters James runs a week can be calculated by multiplying the number of sprints he runs per day (3) by the distance of each sprint (60 meters), and then multiplying that by the number of days he runs per week (3). Therefore, the calculation is 3 sprints/day * 60 meters/sprint * 3 days/week = 540 meters/week.

Reponse: To answer the question, we need to calculate the cost for 16 glasses where every second glass costs 60% of the full price. This means out of 16 glasses, 8 glasses are full priced and 8 glasses are at a discounted price.   First, calculate the cost for the 8 full priced glasses: 8 * $5 = $40.   Second, calculate the cost for the 8 discounted glasses: 8 * ($5 * 0.60) = $24.  Finally, add the two amounts together for the final cost: $40 + $24 = $64.

Reponse: First, let's find out how many glasses are bought at full price and how many at a discount. Since every second glass is bought with a discount, half of the 16 glasses (8) are bought at full price and the other half (8) with a discount.   First, we calculate the total cost of the full price glasses: 8 glasses * $5/glass = $40.   Next, we calculate the total cost of the discount glasses: 8 glasses * $5/glass * 60% = $24.  Finally, we sum these two amounts to get the total cost.

Reponse: The question states that every second glass costs 60% of the original price, which is $5. This means Kylar would pay $5 for the first glass, and $3 for the second (60% of $5 is $3). He wants to buy 16 glasses, so he would pay full price for half of them (8 glasses) and discounted price for the other half (8 glasses).   So, the total cost would be calculated as follows: (8 glasses * $5) + (8 glasses * $3) = $40 + $24 = $64  G1: 64 P1: 100%  The question is straightforward and there are no multiple ways to interpret it.
