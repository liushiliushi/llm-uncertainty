Reponse: First, it's necessary to determine how many eggs Janet is left with after eating and baking. Janet starts with 16 eggs, eats 3, and uses 4 for baking, which leaves her with 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs. Then, because she sells the remainder of her eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, we can calculate her daily earnings by multiplying the number of eggs by the price per egg. So, Janet's daily earnings from the farmers' market would be 9 * $2 = $18.  G1: 18 P1: 100%  Given the information provided in the question, there is no other reasonable guess or interpretation. Therefore, there are no second, third, or fourth guesses.  G2: N/A P2: N/A G3: N/A P3: N/A G4: N/A P4: N/A

Reponse: First, we need to calculate the number of eggs Janet has left after she eats three for breakfast and uses four for baking. This is 16 (total eggs) - 3 (breakfast) - 4 (baking) = 9 eggs.  Then, we need to multiply this number by the price she sells each egg for at the farmers' market, which is $2. This is 9 (eggs) * 2 (price per egg) = $18.

Reponse: To solve this, we need to calculate the remainder of eggs after Janet eats three for breakfast and bakes muffins with four. Then we multiply the remainder by the selling price of each egg at the farmers' market.   1. Number of eggs laid per day = 16 2. Eggs consumed by Janet = 3 3. Eggs used for baking muffins = 4 4. Total eggs used by Janet = 3 + 4 = 7 5. Remainder of eggs for sale = 16 - 7 = 9 6. Price of each egg = $2 7. Total sales at farmers' market = 9 * $2 = $18  G1: 18 P1: 100%  As this is a straightforward calculation, there are no alternative answers or probabilities.

Reponse: Reasoning: The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. Half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt. Therefore, the total number of bolts required is the sum of the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber, which is 2+1=3.  G1: 3 P1: 100%  Note: As this is a straightforward math problem and there are no other guess possibilities based on the provided information, no further guesses will be given.

Reponse: The first step is to calculate the total distance James runs in a day. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, he runs a total of 3 * 60 = 180 meters in a day.  Next, we multiply this daily distance by the number of days in a week he runs. Since he runs 3 days a week, he sprints a total of 180 * 3 = 540 meters a week.

Reponse: James runs 3 sprints per session, and he runs 3 sessions a week. Therefore, the total number of sprints he runs a week is 3 sprints/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 sprints/week. Each sprint is 60 meters, so the total distance he runs a week is 9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters/week.  G1: 540 P1: 100%  Given the mathematical nature of the problem and the clear-cut method of calculating the solution, there's no room for alternate guesses. Therefore, there are no G2, G3, or G4, and hence P2, P3, and P4 are also not applicable.

Reponse: The calculation here is straightforward. James runs 3 sprints, each of 60 meters, so a single day's running distance is 3*60 = 180 meters. He does this 3 times a week, so the total distance run in a week is 3*180 = 540 meters.  G1: 540 P1: 100%  As the question provides direct information and the calculation is simple, there is essentially no uncertainty and therefore no less probable guesses. Therefore, no other guesses are provided.

Reponse: First, we need to calculate the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her entire flock. Since each chicken needs three cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, she needs a total of 3*20 = 60 cups of feed per day.  Next, we subtract the amount of feed she has already given her chickens. She gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15+25 = 40 cups.  Finally, we subtract this total from the amount of feed she needs for the entire day to find out how much she needs to give them in the final meal. So, 60-40 = 20 cups of feed.  G1: 20 P1: 100%  Since the question is based on simple arithmetic and the information given leaves no room for ambiguity, there are no less probable guesses.

Reponse: To solve this problem, we first need to understand how the pricing works. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of the price, meaning it costs $3.   The total number of glasses Kylar wants to buy is 16. As every second glass costs less, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find out how many glasses of each price he needs to buy.  So, he needs to buy 8 glasses at $5 each and 8 glasses at $3 each.   To find the total cost, we can multiply the number of glasses by their respective prices and then add these two amounts together.  Let's calculate:  8 glasses * $5/glass = $40 8 glasses * $3/glass = $24  Total cost: $40 + $24 = $64  G1: 64 P1: 100%  Since the problem is straightforward and does not have any variables, there are no other likely answers. Therefore, answers G2 to G4 and probabilities P2 to P4 are not applicable.  G2: Not applicable P2: Not applicable G3: Not applicable P3: Not applicable G4: Not applicable P4: Not applicable
