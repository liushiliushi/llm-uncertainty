hint_responses:{'trail_0': "First, it's necessary to determine how many eggs Janet is left with after eating and baking. Janet starts with 16 eggs, eats 3, and uses 4 for baking, which leaves her with 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs. Then, because she sells the remainder of her eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, we can calculate her daily earnings by multiplying the number of eggs by the price per egg. So, Janet's daily earnings from the farmers' market would be 9 * $2 = $18.\n\nG1: 18\nP1: 100%\n\nGiven the information provided in the question, there is no other reasonable guess or interpretation.
